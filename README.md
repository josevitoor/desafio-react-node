Desafio em React e Node JS

## Commits

- initial api setup: Initializing the project by creating an 'api' folder where the Node.js backend implementation will take place. Additionally, I performed the initial installation of the key tools I would use for this: node, nodemon, express, Docker configuration, and the beginning of the PostgreSQL database setup.

- using prisma and set routes: Using Prisma for PostgreSQL database implementation and creating routes for transaction listing and transaction upload.

- integrating back and front: Creating a React app and integrating the backend with the frontend using Axios. Some Ant Design components were used for the form. Additionally, some modifications were made to the upload route to enable parsing of the text document.
